# Cat-and-Dog-Image-Classifier

## 🐾 Introduction
Welcome to the Cat and Dog Image Classifier project! This project is all about developing an image classification model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. It's an excellent way to dive into the world of computer vision and deep learning using Python.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify images as either a cat or a dog. This project serves as a great introduction to image classification and the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of cats and dogs and is available on Kaggle. This dataset provides a rich source of images to train and evaluate our classification model.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries
We'll be using the following tools and libraries:

Python: The primary programming language for this project.

TensorFlow/Keras: To build and train the convolutional neural network (CNN).

OpenCV: For image preprocessing tasks.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data and model performance.

## 🚀 Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Resizing and normalizing images.
Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.

Model Building:
Implementing a CNN to capture the features of cat and dog images.
Using techniques like data augmentation to improve model performance.

Model Training:
Training the model on the dataset and fine-tuning hyperparameters.

Evaluation:
Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
Visualizing the model’s performance through loss and accuracy plots.

## 📝 Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with image classification, making it a perfect entry point into deep learning and computer vision. By the end of this project, you’ll have a model capable of distinguishing between cats and dogs with high accuracy.
